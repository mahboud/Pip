- gesture or button to individually mute each player
- when looping the player, don't return to the beginning, but return to the start offset
    - for pips that don't start till later this is a challenge
    - for pips that continue until after the main then have main loop-end also end the pips
    - for pips that should end before the end of main, there's some extra work here



xml file:
- number of videos
- whether pips are locked and un-mainable
- provide starting offsets for all pips with respect to main player
    - provide end offsets for pips that should end before the end point
    - some pips may stay paused until main reaches an offset and then start playing
- read individual player volume settings from the xml file
